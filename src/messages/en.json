While studying at Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia I learned the basics of programming, but personal projects and small freelance work taught me what it truly means to build a website. I spent countless hours exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before falling in love with React.js and Next.js, especially the App Router that gives complete control to craft elegant and efficient UI/UX."
